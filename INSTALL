It develop for Debian, but it should work on other distributions too. Need at least this packages:

apache2 nginx supervisor php5-cgi (for PHP hosting) python python-pip python-virtualenv postfix couried-imap(ssl)|pop(ssl)|authlib (for mail support) and maybe some more

Create virtualenv for PCP and continue with:

git clone https://github.com/creckx/pcp.git
cd pcp
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo cp pcp_runner.py /usr/local/bin/pcp_runner
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/pcp_runner (its used for remote control of server)
sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/apps.d/
cd wsgiadmin
# in settings.local, set the database connection and maybe other values
python manage.py syncdb
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver

Now it should work.

In administration set at least one server in Apps/Servers and Clients/Machines. Also set same servername (Client/Machines) in config (default_*_machine). Clients/Machines is for old implementation. The hostname setted in Apps/Servers will be used to ssh connection. You should config your .ssh/config and put to the remote side the public key.

Almost everything in wsgiadmin directory is useless right now. I decided make some rewrites and this is result:

apacheconf - old implementation of app hosting, needs to be removed, but i have users which use it so it wont be easy task
apps - apps, new implementation of app hosting, works great for python right now, PHP and static support will be ready in few days, not stable
clients - informations about users
cron - cron, needs to be removed
db - db, needs to be removed, i need merge db with apps
domains - i need to put it away, no domain registration in future, its better solution save domains with apps
emails - emails support, need rework (remove requests style and rewrite it for apps style (apps/apps.py/tools.py)) but work fine now
etc - maybe something from the past
ftps - FTP support, out
requests - tools for request a commands on servers, need to be removed, it has slow and now comfortable design
service - usefull code for rest of apps
settings
stats - payments
templates
useradmin - should be merge with users soon
users - user management, registration, etc.

As you see, a half of the code is marked to remove, but i cant remove it right now, because of users on my hosting http://rosti.cz. In next few weeks i want merge all of functionality of old implementation to apps.

It not easy setup, but it's one of the priorities to make it easier :-) Gl.
If you will need something, write me email or use the jabber. I use same address for both.
